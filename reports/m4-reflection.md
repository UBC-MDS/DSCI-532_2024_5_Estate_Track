# HomeScope Reflection

## Brief reflection on insight, material, feedback
During the development of our project dashboard, the one-on-one discussions with our professor proved immensely valuable. These sessions provided tailored feedback specific to our project's needs and challenges.
The insights gained from these discussions directly influenced several key decisions in our dashboard development. For instance, based on the professor's feedback, we designed the components of our data presentation to ensure that users could understand the key metrics. We also ensured that our layout communicated our dashboard's main purpose effectively. In addition, we could omit repetitions and highlight the important data more clearly. We also introduced interactive elements that allowed users to explore different data segments, which made the dashboard more engaging and informative.
Feedback from other students was also helpful for some touchups and additional modifications to our dashboard.

## Comment on anything that can better support you developing a high quality dashboard
More guidance and information on deployment could help us avoid some chanllenges.

## Any difference from milestone 3
Compared to Milestone 3, we have updated our dashboard in several key areas: widget functionality, layout aesthetics, code efficiency, and written content. We preset two default cities for each province to allow for comparative analysis, thus enhancing the graphs' interpretability. We replaced the original cards that displayed minimum and maximum prices with new metrics: Average Population and Average Income, providing an overview of the demographic and financial context of the selected cities. Additionally, we harmonized the color theme of the bar plots with the overall dashboard theme and revised the positioning and wording of the text for clearer understanding. We updated the interactive map to display only selected cities for greater specificity. The dataset is now read using a binary data storage format to improve performance, and we implemented caching within the app to remember previously outputted results.

- Adding a Table and Implementing a Price Range Slider for Interactive Filtering
We introduced an interactive table with an accompanying price range slider, offering a dynamic tool for data exploration on the dashboard. Users can manipulate the slider to set minimum and maximum price thresholds, thereby customizing the table to show only properties that fall within the selected range. This feature enables more targeted analysis, allowing users to navigate large datasets and identify listings that meet their financial specifications. The seamless interactivity bolsters user engagement, providing a customized and efficient approach to analyzing real estate pricing patterns across various regions or based on different criteria.

## Any difference from the proposal
Overall, we removed the scroll bar, two dropdown menus, one table, and one scatter plot from the proposal, and we replaced it with a distribution graph, a combined bar chart, three built-in buttons, and three cards. We added a logo on the sidebar and applied a section of 'Global control' to make the dashboard more readable. The distribution graph visually illustrated the housing price within the selected cities, the bar charts explored variables that affected on the housing price. Three built-in buttons were close to each plot, which were more convenient for the reader to interact with. Cards explained the overall condition of selected cities. Compared with the proposal, the newly created dashboard delivered more meaningful housing information and highly correlated with our project goal. 

## Limitation and future improvement
The dataset only shows the housing data for 2023, which limits the function of presenting the historical trend and predicting the future trend. This is crucial for analyzing the market dynamics, especially in real estate. A lack of confoundings such as economic indicators might limit the dashboard in analyzing the house price. Instead of using the number of bedrooms, more property types (condo, apartment) will allow for a more detailed analysis. In the future, providing a time series analysis would prompt a more in-depth data analysis. More neighbourhood attributes such as community facilities, housing density, and green space are also important for analyzing a real estate price.
