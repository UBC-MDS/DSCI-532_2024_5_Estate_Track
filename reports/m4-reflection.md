# HomeScope Reflection

## Brief reflection on insight, material, feedback


## Comment on anything that can better support you developing a high quality dashboard


## Any difference from milestone 3
Compared with milestone 3, we updated our dashboard in the following area: widgets functionality, layout aesthetics, code efficiency, and written text. We set two default cities for each province to show a comparison, enhancing the graph interpretability. We replaced the original cards (Minimum and Maximum Price) with two new values (Average Population and Average Income), providing an overview of the demographic and financial situation of the selected cities. Moreover, we adjusted the color theme in bar plots corresponding to overall dashboard theme, and changing the position and content of text to facilitate easy understanding for readers. We updated the interactive map to only show the selected cities, instead of showing the province, to be more specific. We read our dataset using the binary data storage format to improve the performance and implemented cache in apps to remember the results which outputted before. 

## Any difference from proposal
Overall, we removed the scroll bar, two dropdown menus, one table, and one scatter plot from the proposal, and we replaced with a distribution graph, a combined bar chart, three built-in buttons, and three cards. We added a logo on side-bar and applied a section of 'Global control' to make the dashboard more readability. The distribution graph visually illustrated the housing price within the selected cities, the bar charts explored variables affected on the housing price. Three built-in buttons were close to each plot, which is more convenient for reader to interact. Cards explained the overall condition of selected cities. Compared with the proposal, the newly created dashboard delivered more meaningful housing information and highly correlated with our project goal. 

## Limitation and future improvement
The dataset only shows the housing data of 2023, which limit the function in presenting the historical trend and predicting the future trend. This is crucial for analyzing the market dynamics, especially in real estate. Lack of confoundings such as economic indicators might limit the dashboard in analyzing the house price. Instead of using the number of bedrooms, more property types (condo, apartment) will allow for a more detailed analysis. In the future, providing a time series analysis would prompt a more in-depth data analysis. More neighborhood attributes such as community facilities, housing density, green space are also important for analyzing a real estate price.
