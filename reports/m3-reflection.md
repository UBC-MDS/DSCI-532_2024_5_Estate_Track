# HomeScope Reflection

## Current State

In milestone 3, we updated our dashboard based on the instructor review and addressed feedback from our cohort. Our dashboard contains an interactive map, two bar charts, a histogram, and several widgets. Compared with milestone 2, we have removed two scatter plots and substituted with a bar chart, describing the top 5 bedroom or bathroom type in selecting cities.

We adjust the original bar plot, which comparing two numerical variables among cities, with additional y-axis and tooltip to delivery information more clearly. The histogram shows.......

## Conclusion, Limitation and Future Improvements

In conclusion, our dashboard mostly aligns with our initial scratch. We applied different tools and charts to maximize our dashboard functionality and interactively. We apply the similar color theme to visually guarantee and grasp our viewer's attention with interacting with our dashboard. The dashboard responds fluidly to changes in input values, such as province, cities, and other attributes. Hopefully, in the future, we can add more functions such as extending the comparison between cities among procince to the country.
