# HomeScope Reflection

## Current State

Currently, we conduct our dashboard with basic functions and graphs.
We have successfully integrated two scatter plots, a bar chart, a histogram and an interactive map.
We provide a list of widgets such as selecting a province and cities, number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
We ensure that cities are only displayed under their respective provinces to improve dashboard clarity.
The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and housing prices, providing clear insights into how these attributes influence housing prices.
The bar chart highlights differences between cities, especially by allowing users to compare numerical features across multiple locations.
The geospatial graph leverages longitude and latitude data to outline country boundaries, enabling users to easily compare real estate locations and make informed decisions visually.
The price distribution histogram visualizes the house price in each province as selected by the user.
The added cards ensure that the app dynamically reflects the full range of price statistics for real estate listings within the chosen province, providing a comprehensive overview.

## Next Steps

In the next milestone, we aim to enhance the dashboard's efficiency and aesthetic appeal by refining the positioning, shape, and color of each element, including buttons and charts.
We will also modify the graph formats to better suit the data structure.

## Different from Initial Sketch

The most significant deviation from our initial design is the consolidation of two bar charts into one grouped bar chart.
This change was made for efficiency and ease of comparison, such as when users wish to explore the relationship between house prices and population across several cities.
This grouped bar chart allows for the comparison of these phenomena within a single visualization.
We have added two additional widgets to the sidebar, enabling users to switch between features of interest more seamlessly.
The inclusion of a scatter plot and cards, strategies learned from lectures, has proven to be a valuable addition to our dashboard.

## Conclusion, Limitation and Future Improvements

In conclusion, our dashboard mostly aligns with our initial scratch.
We applied different tools to maximize our dashboard functionality and interactively.
The dashboard responds fluidly to changes in input values, such as province, cities, and other attributes.
However, there is more space for us to elevate the dashboard to be more professional.
This is due to the time restriction.
We are hopeful that in the future, we can further enhance the dashboard to deliver even more meaningful information to our end-users.
