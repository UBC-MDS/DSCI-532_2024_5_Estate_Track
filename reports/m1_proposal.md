## Section 2: Description of the data

We will present a visual analysis of a dataset encompassing 35,768 real estate prices from 2023, focusing on the 45 most popular Canadian cities as identified by the 2021 census. Each real estate relates to nine distinct features, playing a critical role in determining its market value. Features are categorized based on functions as following:

\- House location: \`Province\`, \`City\`, \`Address\`, \`Latitude\`, \`Longitude\`

\- House structure: \`Number_Beds\`, \`Number_Baths\`

\- Social aspects: \`Median_Family_Income\`, \`Population\`

Based on these given features, our analysis will extend to calculate the average property prices within each city, subsequently ranking them by provinces to facilitate a more detailed data exploration. Investigations such as analyzing the relationship between a city's median income and house pricing will also enhance our client's interpretation of the fluctuating market. We believe that data exploration acts as the foundation supporting visualizations and more data analysis will be conducted during this process as needed.
