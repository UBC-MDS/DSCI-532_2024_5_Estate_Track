Our `HomeScope` team, comprised of adept developers and data scientists, is driven by a shared passion for inclusivity and technology. Our expertise in data analysis underpins our commitment to this project.

### Project Summary

`HomeScope` is an analytical platform dedicated to illuminating the real estate market's complexities. Aimed at stakeholders such as investors, developers, market analysts, and urban planners, it provides actionable insights through the careful analysis of pivotal variables influencing property values.
