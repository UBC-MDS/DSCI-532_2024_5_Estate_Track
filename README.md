## Project Summary

HomeScope is a data analysis project aimed at equipping stakeholders in the real estate industry with actionable insights, derived from a comprehensive analysis of key variables affecting real estate prices. Our dashboard meticulously examines factors such as city demographics, number of beds and baths, population, and median family income, illuminating the intricate dynamics that influence property prices. This allows stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding property investments, pricing strategies, and market positioning.
